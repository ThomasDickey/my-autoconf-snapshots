These are the autoconf macros which I use for maintaining several programs,
including ncurses, xterm, lynx, vile.  They are maintained in a split form,
one macro per file.  I wrote utilities to split/join these (acsplit/acmerge)
in August 1997, and much later (April 2003) wrote a checkin-script which
provides the version numbers in each file.

The files are named according to the macro they contain.  A few are customized
or improved versions from other packages.  All of the ones which I wrote are
named using a "CF_" prefix.  A few macros are useful only for specific
programs; most are useful building blocks for the configure scripts which I
maintain.
