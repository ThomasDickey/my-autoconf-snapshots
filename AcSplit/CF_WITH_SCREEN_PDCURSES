dnl -----------------------
dnl Call this macro before CF_ENABLE_WARNINGS for configure scripts which use
dnl the "--with-screen=pdcurses" selection.  Doing that allows the configure
dnl script to search for the X11/Xt header files to declare (or not) the
dnl symbol needed to enable "const" in those header files.  If that configure
dnl option is not used, then those checks are unnecessary.
