dnl CF_CC_ENV_FLAGS version: 5 updated: 2016/08/27 11:24:46
dnl ---------------
dnl Check for user's environment-breakage by stuffing CFLAGS/CPPFLAGS content
dnl into CC.  This will not help with broken scripts that wrap the compiler
dnl with options, but eliminates a more common category of user confusion.
dnl
dnl In particular, it addresses the problem of being able to run the C
dnl preprocessor in a consistent manner.
dnl
dnl Caveat: this also disallows blanks in the pathname for the compiler, but
dnl the nuisance of having inconsistent settings for compiler and preprocessor
dnl outweighs that limitation.
