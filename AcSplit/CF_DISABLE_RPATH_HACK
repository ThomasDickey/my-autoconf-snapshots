dnl CF_DISABLE_RPATH_HACK version: 3 updated: 2021/01/05 20:14:44
dnl ---------------------
dnl The rpath-hack makes it simpler to build programs, particularly with the
dnl *BSD ports which may have essential libraries in unusual places.  But it
dnl can interfere with building an executable for the base system.  Use this
dnl option in that case.
