#serial 1
# This test replaces the one in autoconf.
# Currently this macro should have the same name as the autoconf macro
# because gettext's gettext.m4 (distributed in the automake package)
# still uses it.  Otherwise, the use in gettext.m4 makes autoheader
# give these diagnostics:
#   configure.in:556: AC_TRY_COMPILE was called before AC_ISC_POSIX
#   configure.in:556: AC_TRY_RUN was called before AC_ISC_POSIX
