dnl CF_RESTARTABLE_PIPEREAD is a modified version of AC_RESTARTABLE_SYSCALLS
dnl from acspecific.m4, which uses a read on a pipe (surprise!) rather than a
dnl wait() as the test code.  apparently there is a POSIX change, which OSF/1
dnl at least has adapted to, which says reads (or writes) on pipes for which no
dnl data has been transferred are interruptable _regardless_ of the SA_RESTART
dnl bit.  yuck.
