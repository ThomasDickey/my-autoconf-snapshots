dnl ----------------
dnl Determine the type we should use for chtype (and attr_t, which is treated
dnl as the same thing).  We want around 32 bits, so on most machines want a
dnl long, but on newer 64-bit machines, probably want an int.  If we're using
dnl wide characters, we have to have a type compatible with that, as well.
