dnl Look for the ncurses library.  This is a little complicated on Linux,
dnl because it may be linked with the gpm (general purpose mouse) library.
dnl Some distributions have gpm linked with (bsd) curses, which makes it
dnl unusable with ncurses.  However, we don't want to link with gpm unless
dnl ncurses has a dependency, since gpm is normally set up as a shared library,
dnl and the linker will record a dependency.
