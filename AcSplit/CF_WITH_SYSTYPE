dnl ---------------
dnl For testing, override the derived host system-type which is used to decide
dnl things such as the linker commands used to build shared libraries.  This is
dnl normally chosen automatically based on the type of system which you are
dnl building on.  We use it for testing the configure script.
dnl
dnl This is different from the --host option: it is used only for testing parts
dnl of the configure script which would not be reachable with --host since that
dnl relies on the build environment being real, rather than mocked up.
