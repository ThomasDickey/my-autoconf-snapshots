dnl CF_ANSI_CC_REQD version: 4 updated: 2008/03/23 14:48:54
dnl ---------------
dnl For programs that must use an ANSI compiler, obtain compiler options that
dnl will make it recognize prototypes.  We'll do preprocessor checks in other
dnl macros, since tools such as unproto can fake prototypes, but only part of
dnl the preprocessor.

You have the following choices:
	a. adjust your compiler options
