	* AcSplit/CF_GNUTLS, AcSplit/CF_SSL: add comment

2008-12-24  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_FIND_LINKAGE:
	add a verbose message, to tell what we're searching for.

	* AcSplit/CF_PKG_CONFIG:
	add a --with option, to allow this to be disabled (per lynx-dev complaint
	that pkg-config was found in ports, and did not have a way to suppress it,
	to build solely from base libraries).

2008-12-18  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* config.sub: 2008-12-11

	* config.guess: 2008-12-19

2008-12-15  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_SSL:
	correct second check of the $1 parameter, which broke configuration without
	the pkg-config file.

2008-12-13  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_RULES:
	for ncurses, if I use --without-manpages, then the man/Makefile will not
	be executed.  Move the distclean action to delete edit_man.* to the parent
	directory.

	* AcSplit/CF_SRC_MODULES:
	duh - overlooked first assignment to SRC_SUBDIRS when implementing the
	"--without-manpages" option.

	* AcSplit/CF_XOPEN_SOURCE:
	add FreeMiNT ncurses support, from GenToo #250454

	* AcSplit/CF_PROG_LDCONFIG:
	build-fix for dragonfly, from NetBSD patch for ncurses port

2008-12-11  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_GNUTLS:
	hmm - unsure if Debian simply does not package the gnutls-openssl script
	for pkg-config, but leave it as a possibility

	* AcSplit/CF_GNUTLS: looks ok - pkg-config checks.

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_SSL_X509:
	make this a "define" to avoid odd problems including it from CF_SSL and CF_GNUTLS

2008-12-09  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_GNUTLS: start integrating pkg-config

	* AcSplit/CF_GNUTLS: reindent'd

	* AcSplit/CF_SSL: make this properly verbose

	* AcSplit/CF_SSL: revised to use pkg-config, if available

2008-12-07  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_HEADER_PATH:
	lynx - someone reported a problem using --with-ssl=XXX, and I realized that
	I'd added the XXX to CPPFLAGS, which wouldn't be tested in CF_SUBDIR_PATH.

	* AcSplit/CF_LIBRARY_PATH:
	lynx: add-back values from LDFLAGS/LIBS which happen to be -L's, in case
	an option (such as --with-ssl=XXX) set the environment variables.

2008-11-08  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_RULES: implement "--without-manpages" option

2008-11-01  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_NC_ALLOC_H: let's use --disable-leaks instead.

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_NC_ALLOC_H:
	make this use --with-no-leaks option (since I changed CDK's configure script
	to use that macro).

2008-10-30  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_CURSES_LIBS:
	add pdcurses library to search list, used in CDK by Gregory Sharp (from
	patch  7 Jul 2007).

2008-10-25  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_SHARED_OPTS: add case for QNX 6 (works for me)

2008-10-18  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_LDFLAGS_STATIC:
	have to cancel these symbols for OS/2 EMX as well, since the -static
	conflicts with -Zcrtdll

2008-10-17  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_UTF8_LIB:
	rewrote using CF_FIND_LINKAGE; the problem is that the BSDs put packages
	where gcc is not likely to find them, so for any unusual libraries we need
	to add -I and -L options.

2008-10-04  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_AWK_BIG_PRINTF:
	AIX 5.1's nawk choked on printf's bigger than the threshold, writing zero
	bytes.  That fooled my check for record length (since nawk found no records).
	Replace the second stage with a check for number of records and record length.

2008-09-20  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_RULES:
	another tweak - this built both cfg-shared and cfg-thread on cygwin

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_RULES:
	fixes for cygwin and cfg-thread (which builds libtic, libtinfo and libncurses).
	The problem was that the "t" was appended after the $(ABI_VERSION).

2008-09-13  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_RPATH_HACK:
	don't remove the -L option, since we may have static libraries in the same
	directory.

	* AcSplit/CF_SHARED_OPTS:
	paste-in chunk which seems to make openbsd do rpath, adapted from linux

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_SUFFIX: tabsd

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_RULES: add cf_depsuf params to CF_LIB_SUFFIX calls.

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_PREFIX: reformatted

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_SUFFIX:
	merge in the 3rd parameter used in ncurses, so we set both lib- and dep-suffixes
	That's so I can move a chunk of cygwin-specific stuff out of configure.in

	* AcSplit/CF_ENABLE_RPATH: ci-aclocal generated header

	* AcSplit/CF_SHARED_OPTS:
	for openbsd 2.x on, build shared libraries with a release-version appended.
	OpenBSD doesn't have symbolic links in /usr/lib, but does append the
	release xx.yy to each ".so" filename.

2008-09-09  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_MAWK_CHECK_HEADER: use CF_UPPER for case-conversion].

	* AcSplit/CF_MAWK_ADD_NO: don't use translit - again a porting problem

	* AcSplit/CF_MAWK_DEFINE:
	first parameter is now unquoted, since it is a variable set in CF_UPPER

	* AcSplit/CF_MAWK_CHECK_FUNCS, AcSplit/CF_MAWK_CHECK_HEADERS:
	formatting

	* AcSplit/CF_MAWK_CHECK_FUNC: use CF_UPPER

	* AcSplit/CF_MAWK_CHECK_FUNC, AcSplit/CF_MAWK_CHECK_HEADER: add quotes

	* AcSplit/CF_MAWK_CHECK_FUNCS, AcSplit/CF_MAWK_CHECK_HEADERS:
	don't use CF_MAWK_REPEAT_IT, since it's likely to be a problem porting to
	newer autoconf's

	ci-aclocal generated header

2008-09-08  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_SHARED_SONAME:
	change cf_shared_soname to cf_cv_shared_soname (a cache variable)

	* AcSplit/CF_SHARED_OPTS:
	rename $cf_shared_soname to $cf_cv_shared_soname

2008-09-06  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_SHARED_OPTS: fix for gcc on IRIX64

	* AcSplit/CF_AWK_BIG_PRINTF: ci-aclocal generated header

	* AcSplit/CF_AWK_BIGSTRING: rewrote, adding a special case for mawk.

	* AcSplit/CF_AWK_BIGSTRING: ci-aclocal generated header

		http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/config

2008-08-23  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_PTHREAD:
	change from AC_CHECK_LIB to AC_TRY_LINK, since OSF/1 5.1 (at least) does
	symbol mangling, e.g., puts "__" in the front of the symbol name in the
	library.  An explicit link makes the test work.

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_LOCALE_ALIAS:
	rewrote to make the default value "smart" (based on a list)

2008-08-22  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_ENVIRON: fix comment

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_ENVIRON: ci-aclocal generated header

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_ERRNO: implement a second parameter

2008-08-21  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_X_FONTENC:
	second cut of rewrite - needs some testing, but should be minor fixes.

2008-08-20  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_X_FONTENC:
	start rewriting this so it will work w/o pkg-config
	it's not complete - $withval could be "yes" if not given.
	but I did fix the name of the library (fontenc, not Xfont).

2008-08-16  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_WEAK_SYMBOLS: ci-aclocal generated header

2008-08-11  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_PERL:
	rename LINK_PREFIX to avoid conflict(?) with old Purify hack.
	add a link-test, in case the library is actually missing (casualty of packagers)

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_PERL: ci-aclocal generated header

2008-08-04  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	Subject: xterm problem in DragonFly BSD
	To: dickey@invisible-island.net

	[-- Attachment #1 --]
	[-- Type: text/plain, Encoding: 7bit, Size: 0.5K --]

	Xterm doesn't compile in latest DragonFly BSD:

	../charproc.c:3242: error: for each function it appears in.)

	It worked in older versions because fd_mask wasn't guarded by __BSD_VISIBLE.

	many DragonFly BSD users.

	* AcSplit/CF_GCC_WARNINGS:
	give up on -Winline for a while - gcc 4.3.1 appears to have no workable
	settings that make ncurses's inlining work w/o warnings.

2008-07-05  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_LDFLAGS_STATIC:
	suppress gcc's own static/dynamic flags on AIX, since the latest (gcc 4.2.4)
	does not link test/bs anymore.  That is because bs.c uses getlogin, which
	isn't picked up properly.  For details, I added -Wl,b,noquiet to the end
	of the link-line.  Here's the properly-working linkage:

	From: Poor Yorick <org.gnu.bug-ncurses@pooryorick.com>
	Subject: undefined symbol "main" when compiling libXpm,
	        which depends on ncurses
	To: bug-ncurses@gnu.org
	X-Mailer: WebMail 2.55

	For the record:  compiling ncurses on SunOS 5.9, with gcc-4.2.2 and, it was
	necessary to patch ncurses install with a '-shared' flag.  Otherwise,
	libncurses(w).so.5.6 was linked as an executable with a "main" symbol, causing
	a subsequent install of any software package depending on libncurses to fail,
	complaining about undefined "main" symbol:
	-------TD: tww's using gcc 3.4.3, which works fine w/o the "-shared" option.
	It is specific to gcc.  While reading Sun's cc manpage, I see this note
	about the PIC options:

	     -KPIC
	          (SPARC) Obsolete. You should not use this option. Use
	          -xcode=pic32 instead. For a complete list of obsolete
	          options and flags, see the C User's Guide.

	          (x86) -KPIC is identical to -Kpic on x86 architectures.

	     -Kpic
	          (SPARC) Obsolete. You should not use this option. Use
	          -xcode=pic13 instead. For a complete list of obsolete
	          options and flags, see the C User's Guide.

	          (x86) Generate position-independent code for use in
	          shared libraries (small model). Permits references to,
	          at most, 2**11 unique external symbols

	So I changed to use the -xcode option.

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_LIBTOOL: from bug-ncurses:
	From: 	Michael Haubenwallner
	Subject: 	minor issues when building ncurses-5.6 with libtool
	Date: 	Thu, 20 Mar 2008 17:52:58 +0100

	Hi,

	there are two minor issues (depending on libtool and compiler used).
	1) The libtool object files are still called '.o' (should be '.lo').
	2) libtool might not detect that it should use tag 'CC'.

	Can't remember the actual error messages, but those two have shown up on
	aix when using CC=powerpc-ibm-aix5.3.0.0-gcc.

	Attached patch fixes them.

	Thanks!

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_SSL_X509:
	TG insists that he's got a const or something like that in the
	prototype for (X509_STORE_CTX_get_error() - tweak the check.

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_TYPE:

	* AcSplit/CF_SSL:
	patch to check X509 support after establishing libraries - Thorsten Glaser

2007-12-17  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_FUNC_ICONV:
	tweak to make cf_cv_func_iconv set to "yes" if I do find the function in
	"-liconv".  Noticed on cygwin that I had to do this (a shame that cygwin
	doesn't provide locale support).

2007-12-01  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_HASHED_DB_VERSION:
	for grins, look for db5 - I see Debian has a package

	don't try to update LDFLAGS if there's no applicable rpath-hack

	* AcSplit/CF_LEX_VERSION:
	lex on AIX (even 5.1) doesn't stop on error from illegal option - it starts
	reading the data from stdin.  Adjust test to avoid hanging.

2007-11-24  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	don't need check for empty param before CF_ADD_LIBDIR

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_BZLIB, AcSplit/CF_WITH_ZLIB:
	rewrote using CF_FIND_LINKAGE

	* AcSplit/CF_FIND_LINKAGE: use CF_ADD_INCDIR

	* AcSplit/CF_SOCKS5: use CF_ADD_OPTIONAL_PATH
	Considered using CF_FIND_LINKAGE, but decided not to, since this is used
	rarely (in lynx), and because the logic for finding socks5 versus the
	socks4 prefix is fragile.

	* AcSplit/CF_ADD_OPTIONAL_PATH: ci-aclocal generated header

	tweak messages to avoid leaving unneeded "CF_" strings in the configure script

	* AcSplit/AM_ICONV, AcSplit/CF_GNUTLS, AcSplit/CF_SSL:
	use CF_ADD_OPTIONAL_PATH

	* AcSplit/CF_ADD_INCDIR:

	gcc done for BSD ports...)

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_SSL_X509: ci-aclocal generated header

	* AcSplit/CF_GNUTLS: misc fixes - got this working with lynx.

	* AcSplit/CF_FIND_HEADER, AcSplit/CF_SSL, AcSplit/CF_WITH_BZLIB, AcSplit/CF_WITH_ZLIB:
	use CF_ADD_INCDIR

	* AcSplit/CF_NCURSES_CC_CHECK:
	parameter-2 wasn't used in one case where the usual-parameter $cf_header
	was - fix.

	* AcSplit/CF_CURSES_LIBS: detab'd

	* AcSplit/AM_WITH_NLS: use CF_ADD_LIBDIR

	* AcSplit/CF_ADD_LIBDIR:
	rewrote - don't simply suppress tokens that are not directories, but also
	filter out /usr/lib and check for directories already in $LDFLAGS.
	change the variable from $LIBS to $LDFLAGS, but allow it to be overridden
	for macros that collect the options in a separate variable.

	use CF_ADD_LIBDIR

	* AcSplit/CF_ADD_SUBDIR_PATH: make a message clearer

	* AcSplit/CF_VERBOSE:
	add a call to CF_MSG_LOG so the same information goes to config.log

	* AcSplit/CF_ADD_SUBDIR_PATH: ci-aclocal generated header

	* AcSplit/CF_FIND_LINKAGE:
	put the CF_VERBOSE in the loops _before_ the test, to make it simpler to
	see what was tested before the "found" message.

	* AcSplit/CF_SUBDIR_PATH: split-out CF_ADD_SUBDIR_PATH
	also change order of tests to put /usr, $prefix first to lessen user surprise

	* AcSplit/CF_GCC_ATTRIBUTES, AcSplit/CF_GCC_WARNINGS:
	use $as_me if defined

	* AcSplit/CF_MSG_LOG:
	use autoconf 2.5x's $as_me variable if defined, to put the script name in the log.
	make the line-number formatted like the other configure-lineno stuff.

2007-07-28  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_FIND_LINKAGE:

	Tested with Heirloom sed (since it was simpler than getting
	an imake configuration on Solaris to match X.Org), and found two
	main problems:
		a) some bogus bug prevented "[^- ]" from matching where "[^ -]" does.
		b) sed didn't like the nested \(...\) I was using - didn't even assign
		   it a different \3 or something like that.  It just didn't match.
	So I filtered out the tabs first, then wrote a loop in the sed script to
	convert "embedded" spaces in a parameter value to tabs (since that seems
	to be the safest character for a magic replacement).  Then I could simplify
	the name=value part to an expression that didn't need any nesting of \(...\).

	Hi,

	When installing dialog with 'make -j# install', it's possible to get an
	error when several processes try to create the same directory at the
	same time. This can happen because mkdir fails when a directory already
	exists, and the directory can be created between the test ! -d and the
	mkdir in mkdirs.sh. This can easily be solved by changing mkdir to mkdir
	-p, which silently returns if the directory already exists. If there are
	systems you support that do not provide the -p option to mkdir, an
	alternative approach is to ignore mkdir's return value, and run test -d
	afterwards. A third option is to say you don't support parallel
	installs, but I'm hoping you don't take that approach. :)

	Thanks,
	Harald .
	-------TD: I did the alternative approach, since I'm unsure about mkdir -p.

	Dear Thomas,

	I do not compile ncurses via libtool, but just to have things fixed.

	Apple provides libtool that is not command-line compatible with GNU libtool.
	Apple provides GNU libtool as glibtool (/usr/bin/glibtool).
	Package managment system Macports provides GNU libtool as
	glibtool (/opt/local/bin/glibtool)
	Its competitor Fink installs GNU libtool as  /sw/bin/glibtool or
	/sw/bin/libtool, I am not sure.

	Ergo it looks like a good idea to look for glibtool, if search
	for libtool fails, or libtool turns out not to be GNU libtool.

	I am not sure.
	May be the user MUST manually point configure to the correct libtool
	using command-line option if anything is non-standart?

	To: Thomas Dickey <dickey@his.com>

	Dear Thomas,

	since you applied the following change

	Rather than copying the build-tree's libraries, link the shared
	  objects into the install directory.

	a problem surfaced on Mac OS X (whith --disable-libtool, --enable-shared),
	installed libraries are linked against libraries in build locations,
	 not instal locations (as described at
	http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/macports-users/2007-January/001342.html)

	I suspect that DESTDIR in the following configure line breaks things.

	MK_SHARED_LIB='${CC} ${CFLAGS} -dynamiclib -install_name
	${DESTDIR}${libdir}/`basename $@` -compatibility_version ${ABI_VERSION}
	-current_version ${ABI_VERSION} -o $@'

	Since DESTDIR sets temporary location where things are installed before
	being moved to a proper place by package management system, there is
	no reason to include DESTDIR in their install_names (Mac OS analog of
	rpath).

	     Sincerely, Michail
	------TD: the relinking is going to be a problem (address that with an
	option), while the ${DESTDIR} dates to Jason Evan's initial mods for
	Darwin in 2001.  I agree that it doesn't appear to be needed/wanted - removed.

	a.out and lib.so use the same glue but a.out adds one extra bit,
	the call to main.  The particular object files in question are
	crti.o and crtn.o, they're used to bracket all .o files like this:


	        crti.o .... *.o .... crtn.o

	crti.o contains an .init section with the _init function preamble
	and a .fini section with the _fini function preamble

	crtn.o contains an .init section with a function epilogue
	and a .fini with the same.

	It generally works without it except when you:

	        - use #pragma init
	        - use #pragma fini
	        - use __attribute__((constructor))
	        - use __attribute__((destructor))

	and C++ code which needs static initalizers.

	It mostly works, but I remember one particular occasion when someone
	change libc.so to contain a different crypt() an dhe then proceeded
	to relink the library with "ld".  The resulting library did not
	call fflush() on exit causing no end to trouble.

	Casper

	--------- reviewing, I see Linux already did use "${CC}".

	Checking, I see IRIX64 can do this also, though the sections do not add
	and .init/.fini -- rather, it adds a ".conflict" section:

	[18]    |   4205076|       8|SECT |LOCL |DEFAULT  |MIPS_DATA|.conflict

	also some weak symbols

	[32]    |   4205092|       0|FUNC |WEAK |DEFAULT  |UNDEF  |attr_get
	[33]    |   4205092|       0|FUNC |WEAK |DEFAULT  |UNDEF  |attr_set

	Finally - I see that nm's listing for libc symbols contains offset
	values rather than 0's.  I think that is an improvement.

	* AcSplit/CF_MAN_PAGES:

	chunk uses it only in a generated script.  Renamed it anyway to avoid

	CF_X_TOOLKIT adds $X_PRE_LIBS and $X_EXTRA_LIBS to $LIBS, so I don't want to
	repeat that here.

	* AcSplit/CF_X_TOOLKIT:
	add $X_EXTRA_LIBS when completing the library list.
	(this isn't the autoconf assumption, but does simplify building up other tests).

	* AcSplit/CF_X_FREETYPE:
	rewrote so I can nominally support pre-package versions of FreeType.
	This worked for Debian 2.2 (may work for Redhat 7.2 - haven't tested if
	I also need -lrender).

	* AcSplit/CF_MAKEFLAGS:
	NetBSD 2.0 spits out a trailing blank on the testcase I made for the -k
	option.  That made it not handle the case ".*k)".  I tried adding a
	pattern for blanks after - but NetBSD's shell couldn't handle _that_
	either.  Dumbed it down by trimming the trailing blank(s) with a sed
	script.

	* AcSplit/CF_SHARED_OPTS:
	widened the FreeBSD check to version 6 (should invert the case to cover

	another bit of breakage from the 2000 rewrite of -rpath

	Subject: [Lynx-dev] DJGPP patch for 2.8.6dev.18
	To: lynx-dev@nongnu.org

	This is a minor patch for two items that affect portability to DJGPP.

	The first is a change to aclocal.m4 from "test -f" to "test -x". This
	is important because if testing for "xgettext" and a file exists
	called "xgettext.exe", "test -f" fails and "test -x" succeeds. Since
	the line in aclocal.m4 is testing for an executable file, the change
	shouldn't affect other platforms adversely. Without the patch, the
	lynx configuration script doesn't find the utilities needed for NLS.
	The change will be propagated to "configure" when autoconf is run.

	------TD: I pointed out that "test -f" wasn't portable, and DK resubmitted
	the change modifying the test to include the executable suffix, which
	should work.

	Hi Thomas,

	Your last change to CF_X_FREETYPE breaks xterm on darwin; the problem
	is that it is not enough to check that pkg-config exists, we must also
	check that xft.pc exists too, which is not the case on darwin where we
	must so revert to xft-config.  The attached patch fixes it.

	with a -U: Urs Jansen reported that the Intel compiler and Cray compilers
	don't process -U/-D options left-right right, but apparently all -D's and
	then all -U's.

	* AcSplit/CF_POSIX_C_SOURCE:
	Urs Jansen reported that the Intel compiler and the Cray compiler both do
	not process -U and -D options left-to-right.  That is
		cc -Dxx -Uxx -Dxx=5
	would result in a program that does not define xx.  So I modified this to
	not use the -U to cancel, but to strip the conflicting -D from $CFLAGS and
	$CPPFLAGS

	* AcSplit/CF_REMOVE_DEFINE:
	add the pattern for removing the final option
	make this more readable

	* AcSplit/CF_REMOVE_DEFINE: ci-aclocal generated header

	* AcSplit/CF_GNU_SOURCE:
	don't need an AC_REQUIRE for CF_INTEL_COMPILER anymore

	* AcSplit/CF_GCC_WARNINGS:

	platform (some additional nuisances regarding loss of precision).

	* AcSplit/CF_GNU_SOURCE:
	tin - long discussion with Urs regarding icc 9.0, decided to revert the
	change that excluded Intel compiler from using -D_GNU_SOURCE, since it
	seems icc is moving closer to gcc and it's a nuisance to try to duplicate
	the ifdef's that _GNU_SOURCE sets.  Also for some such as vasprintf(),
	that has to be defined anyway.

2005-06-25  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_TYPEOF_CHTYPE:
	split-out the code that invokes CF_UNSIGNED_LITERALS, move that to
	configure.in (ncurses) so I can make --with-chtype=XXX option set the
	$cf_cv_1UL option properly

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_SONAME:

	* AcSplit/CF_TYPEOF_CHTYPE:
	simplified this - we need 31 bits for ncurses' chtype.
	Dan Jacobowitz (Debian maintainer) pointed out that the 'x' variable was
	not initialized, making the test always say "long".  It turns out that the
	test has been broken that way since I first implemented it in 1997.
	Will probably rewrite the test, but decided first to repair it to make it
	do what I intended.  (Also remove the ifdef for WANT_BITS - I don't need

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_IMAKE_CFLAGS:
	make a quick check on the result from CF_IMAKE_CFLAGS to see if we found
	$IMAKE and set $IMAKE_CFLAGS (the first is necessary, the latter is only
	very likely).  If that fails, fall-through as if we're getting --disable-imake

	* AcSplit/CF_IMAKE_CFLAGS:
	skip over most of this if we don't have $IMAKE set

2005-04-02  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_GXX_WARNINGS: hmm (first version was probably for bcpp).
	I rewrote this for ncurses, to try to use g++ to flush out problems with
	its c++ binding, after finding that Solaris c++ complained (rightly) about
	some anachronisms.

2005-02-06  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_IMAKE_CFLAGS:
	repair the sed script for OSMINORVERSION to avoid trailing non-digits
	add a special case for IRIX 5 & 6 to define SYSV and SVR4 (xterm kludge)

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_IMAKE_CFLAGS:
	add a kludge for aix to define AIXV3 and AIXV4 if no imake is used.

	* AcSplit/CF_XOPEN_SOURCE: define _ALL_SOURCE for AIX 4 and 5.

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_IMAKE_CFLAGS:
	ran into problem using uname on AIX (which someone on autoconf list did
	comment about recently).  AIX's uname -r returns the minor version rather
	than the major version.  Use uname -v for the major version.  I don't want
	to own that type of script.  However, config.guess' output is mostly usable,
	giving the major/minor versions for most vendor systems - but not for Linux.
	So if $host_os contains a {digit}.{digit}, I'll use that, otherwise use the
	uname values.

2005-02-05  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_IMAKE_CFLAGS:
	OSF1's uname -r returns "V4.0" for 4.0D, so I modified the sed script to
	strip leading non-digits when getting a value for OSMAJORVERSION

	* AcSplit/CF_IMAKE_CFLAGS:
	typo - I'd left off the blank needed for one of the fix_cflags.sed expressions

2005-02-04  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	If disabled, this macro does not check for the termcap library, and

	To: bug-ncurses@gnu.org
	Cc: jlam@NetBSD.org
	Subject: Ncurses 5.4 on IRIX 5.3 bug report

	The following is a bug report for Ncurses 5.4 on IRIX 5.3:

	ncurses/tinfo/lib_napms.c includes time.h to define struct timespec.
	However, on
	IRIX 5.3 that include file reads as follows:

	#if (defined(_POSIX_4SOURCE) || defined(_SGI_SOURCE)) &&
	!defined(_POSIX_SOURCE)
	 && !defined(_XOPEN_SOURCE)
	#if defined(_LANGUAGE_C) || defined(_LANGUAGE_C_PLUS_PLUS)
	typedef struct timespec {
	        time_t  tv_sec;         /* seconds */
	        long    tv_nsec;        /* and nanoseconds */
	} timespec_t;

	....

	now the problem is that ncurses defines _POSIX_SOURCE (and in addition does
	not
	define _SGI_SOURCE).

	1. The POSIX standard requires that the _POSIX_C_SOURCE macro have a
	   value.  Try the following control argument to gcc:

	   -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200112L

	2. On VOS, you should use either -D_BSD_SOURCE or -D_SVID_SOURCE.
	   You should not use both of them.  I generally define _SVID_SOURCE
	   as it has everything that _BSD_SOURCE has plus additional features.
	   Ditto for setting up your object library search paths.

	Thanks

	  This works around FreeBSD's broken linker semantics when configuring for

	* AcSplit/CF_SSL:

	* AcSplit/CF_GNUTLS:
	modified (like CF_SSL) to be a little more cautious about looking for
	the <gnutls/openssl.h> file, and to accommodate recent change (11/2003)
	to move the openssl-compatibile functions from gnutls-extra to gnutls-openssl

	* AcSplit/CF_SSL:
	fix a conflict with system-installed openssl library and private ssleay
	(I was picking up the headers for the former when looking at the latter).

2004-04-25  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_IMAKE_CFLAGS:
	fix for cases when the IMAKE_CFLAGS and/or IMAKE_LOADFLAGS are empty.

	* AcSplit/CF_IMAKE_CFLAGS:
	hmm - this broke again when I added $(VENDORMANDEFS), since that contained
	different escaping of the quotes.  This seems to work, for xterm #187.

	* AcSplit/CF_IMAKE_CFLAGS:
	the second parameter to xmkmf should be the top of the build tree, not
	the directory containing the cf-files.

	* AcSplit/CF_ADD_CFLAGS:
	fix the first expression for cf_tst_cflags by ensuring we match single
	quote rather than just any character after the '='.  Do a similar fix for
	the "yes" part of the case statement, so we exit on a fragment such as
		xxx"'
	Finally, put any quoted (single-token) -D option into EXTRA_CPPFLAGS.
	That seems to be consistent, though of course we don't handle things like
		-Dxxx=\"foo\"

	* AcSplit/CF_X_FREETYPE:
	add --with-freetype-cflags and --with-freetype-libs options (actually because
	I thought I could use that to override xft-config easily via an option to
	cfg-xterm+, but that didn't work well, so I ended up overriding its cache
	variables).  The options still are useful.

	* AcSplit/CF_IMAKE_CFLAGS:
	if --verbose is set, show the $IMAKE_CFLAGS and $IMAKE_LOADFLAGS at the
	end of this macro.

	* AcSplit/CF_IMAKE_CFLAGS:
	fix the order of setting CDPATH (does not seem to help on my current Debian
	testing, but still better than it was)

	* AcSplit/CF_X_TOOLKIT:
	remove the checks for clix (obsolete) and move the call to AC_PATH_XTRA to
	the beginning - which it essentially was anyway.  Now it simply calls
	AC_PATH_XTRA and ensures that I can get -lXt and -lX11.  Reading the code,
	it seems that the IRIX6/IRIX5 issue was taken care of in autoconf 2.13.

2004-04-24  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_IMAKE_CFLAGS:
	xterm: modify the generated Makefile to use sed-scripts that effectively
	recognize -D options that have non-numeric values.  When those are found,
	this forces quotes around the value.
	See also CF_ADD_CFLAGS, which has to work around limitations in passing
	backslashes and quotes around.

	* AcSplit/CF_ADD_CFLAGS:
	xterm: inspect each -D option to see if it looks like a quoted string.
	We're expecting to see something like
		-D'"xxx"'
	from CF_IMAKE_CFLAGS -> CF_WITH_IMAKE_CFLAGS.  In some cases this
		-D'"xxx yyy"'
	would be passed as
		-D'"xxx
		yyy"'
	so we put it back together in the loop here.  Crude, but it seems the only
	way to cope with $(VENDOR_DEFINES) in the X makefiles.

	* AcSplit/CF_IMAKE_CFLAGS:
	I made a script (cfg-xorg) to run cfg-xterm+ within the X.Org build tree.
	To make this work (since this script prefers xmkmf to imake), I have both
	imake and xmkmf in its cfg-xorg's $PATH.  One more detail is needed to get
	going: xmkmf has to point to the config-files within the build tree rather
	than in its final installed location.  So I added a case to set cf_imake_opts
	to add the build-tree's location to xmkmf as a parameter.

2004-02-28  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_DBMALLOC, AcSplit/CF_WITH_DMALLOC:

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_RULES:
	don't use underscores in awk command-line variables

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_RULES:
	modified to allow ncurses "--with-termlib" option to set the name of the
	terminfo library.

	* AcSplit/CF_SRC_MODULES:
	"$with_termlib" can now have values other than yes/no.

	* AcSplit/CF_PROG_CC_C_O: ci-aclocal generated header

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_RULES:
	pass cc_c_o and cxx_c_o values to mk-2nd.awk, which uses those to decide
	whether to use a cd-command or -c/-o options to get its result into the
	object-directories

2004-01-30  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_CACHE:
	ncurses: revert TG's change since it breaks my build on FreeBSD 3.1

	* AcSplit/CF_BOOL_DECL:
	ncurses: fix for BeOS 4.5, which has bool declared inconsistently in two
	locations.  We can control whether we include <stdbool.h>, but not the
	other (which is buried away in support headers for I/O).

2004-01-26  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_XOPEN_SOURCE: Thorsten Glaser adds a case for mirbsd

	* AcSplit/CF_TAR_OPTIONS: ci-aclocal generated header

	* AcSplit/CF_PATH_PROG:
	tweak to allow a list of programs, use this in lynx to support selecting
	among tar/star/pax

	* AcSplit/AM_GNU_GETTEXT:
	Thorsten Glaser added a check for a system copy of mkinstalldirs (note that
	his check relied on using environment variables, so I fixed it).

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_CACHE:
	Thorsten Glaser noticed a standard variable $ac_config_sub to use.

	* AcSplit/CF_XOPEN_SOURCE:
	oops - defining _XOPEN_SOURCE breaks lynx on SCO (some problems immediately
	with the network headers).

2004-01-24  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_BZLIB:
	original bzip2 1.0.2 header <bzlib.h> does not include <stdio.h>, but uses
	FILE*, so unless someone's fixed it (for a package), I have to add <stdio.h>
	to the includes

2004-01-23  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/AM_WITH_NLS:
	lynx: suppress check for bison if we're not bundling intl/.  The dependency
	upon bison is contrived (not needed for the application), anyway.

	* AcSplit/AM_WITH_NLS:
	lynx: add a check to see if intl/ directory is packaged, and if not to
	stop with an error.

2004-01-22  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_IPV6:
	lynx: treat non-Linux systems comparably to Linux by not exiting with an
	error when getaddrinfo() check fails.

2004-01-19  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_BUILD_CC:
	tin: add 2 parameters to allow me to pick up the proper $CPPFLAGS for build,
	and ensure that the defaults are different when I'm cross-compiling.

	* AcSplit/CF_BUILD_CC: ci-aclocal generated header

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_DBMALLOC, AcSplit/CF_WITH_DMALLOC:
	tin: remove "test:" from usage message.  Add optional parameter to allow
	delaying adding the $LIBS and $CPPFLAGS updates til the end of the script.

	* AcSplit/AM_MULTIBYTE_ABLE:
	corrected the way cache variable interacts with the #define's (based on
	warning message from autoconf 2.52).

2004-01-17  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_WCHAR_TYPE:
	ncurses: Tru64 4.0d headers include files under /usr/include.dtk which
	reference __VA_LIST__ symbol when <wchar.h> is included.  So I included
	<stdarg.h> - not enough, had to add <stdio.h> also.  That made the test
	work.

2004-01-16  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_LIBTOOL:
	add ifdef'd invocation of AC_PROG_LIBTOOL with an example of how to turn
	it on, and documented the reasons why not.  Also improved the sed expression
	for libtool's version - Debian's package adds some stuff in parentheses
	which confused my script because there were digits before the actual version
	number.

2004-01-14  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_BOOL_DECL:
	ncurses: rewrote the check for stdbool.h, since HPUX has a <stdbool.h> that
	defines bool only if the compiler is c99.  In that case, we'll normally
	fall-through to the non-bool case.

2004-01-12  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_XOPEN_SOURCE:
	add special case for NetBSD (hp-testdrive's 1.6 doesn't like _XOPEN_SOURCE).

2004-01-11  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_XOPEN_SOURCE:
	lynx: for IRIX64 (e.g., "irix6.*"), use -D_SGI_SOURCE rather than _XOPEN_SOURCE,
	since defining the latter makes the IPv6 code fail to compile.  I don't see
	that its curses library really supports wide-characters anyway, though we
	have something for mbstate_t.

2004-01-10  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_SRC_MODULES:
	ncurses: tweak so ./progs will link with -ltinfo when --with-termlib is used.

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_RULES:
	ncurses: modify so termlib can have its own extensions 'ext_tinfo', e.g.,
	the version.c module which I moved there.

2004-01-06  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* config.sub, config.guess: tin: 2004-01-05

2004-01-03  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_PROG_EXT:
	ncurses - using AC_EXEEXT made a conflict between explicit suffix and the -Zexe
	flag.  Modified this to set $ac_cv_exeext to bypass the AC_EXEEXT macro
	(which would set both -Zexe and EXEEXT=.exe).

	* AcSplit/CF_OUR_MESSAGES:
	fix sense of help-message - since the default is "yes", the help message
	should show "--disable"

2003-12-31  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_X_FREETYPE:
	fix -DRENDERFONT when there is no freetype, etc., broken by the cygwin/X fix.

	* AcSplit/CF_X_FREETYPE:
	current cygwin/X provides xft-config and freetype-config scripts.  The former
	declares -lXft and -lfontconfig (which are both needed for xterm with AA-fonts).
	The latter only declares -lfreetype.  So I added a check for both, preferring
	the xft-config script.  That got xterm to configure/build.

2003-12-30  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_SYSV:
	back to Slackware 3.6, and found it did not flag any warnings.  But adding
	an include for <stdlib.h> got it to cooperate.  No more "#ifdef linux".

	* AcSplit/CF_X_FREETYPE:
	rewrote this to use freetype-config (which seems to work for Debian 3.0r1
	and current Debian testing - probably not for Redhat9).  The problem was
	that Debian/testing didn't configure Xft because there's a magic header
	needed to compile the test-case.  It seems that freetype-config supplies
	the appropriate -I with "freetype-config --cflags".

2003-12-29  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_XOPEN_SOURCE:
	testing on OpenBSD 2.8 I found the _XOPEN_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE fixes broke ncursesw and xterm.

	* AcSplit/CF_X_FREETYPE: remove redundant -lXrender
	take the -lfontconfig out again, leaving a note for when I have to revisit.

	* AcSplit/CF_SYSV:
	xterm - require CF_SYS_ERRLIST and ensure that sys_errlist is declared.
	That's needed for HPUX which provides it but does not declare it.
	Change the include to Intrinsic.h from Xos.h since it appears that I can
	get Linux (Debian 3.0testing) to error on the redefinition of wchar_t.

2003-12-27  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_SHARED_OPTS:
	change FreeBSD 4.x, 5.x, to use soname.  This differs a little from the
	system's version (libncurses.so.5 versus my libncurses.so.5.3), but doesn't
	seem to do any harm.  I don't see a clean way to check if my library is
	preferred to the system library though.

	I also tried to get -rpath to work, but it didn't work consistently enough
	for me to want it.

	* AcSplit/CF_XOPEN_SOURCE:
	modified the freebsd case so I can build ncursesw also.  I did this on my
	FreeBSD 5.1 - will have to retest on 4.x.  Probably doesn't work for older
	FreeBSD's.

	* AcSplit/CF_XOPEN_SOURCE:
	add definition for _BSD_TYPES (thought I'd done this, but apparently got
	sidetracked with __EXTENSIONS__)

2003-12-20  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_MAN_PAGES:
	always use tbl when creating formatted manpages.
	optionally use tbl when installing unformatted manpages

	* AcSplit/CF_MANPAGE_FORMAT:
	add --with-manpage=catonly flavor, and be more rigorous about allowing
	the various keywords for --with-manpage in any combination.

	* AcSplit/CF_MAN_PAGES:
	not quite a rewrite - this adds support for --with-manpage-format=catonly
	by modifying the man/edit_man.sh script to recur as needed, so the recurrance
	will process formatted manpages.

2003-12-19  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_SYSV: typo: dn/dnl

	* AcSplit/CF_SYSV:
	hmm - I couldn't force a symbol conflict for SIGCHLD/SIGCLD, so I reverted
	part of my changes, just saying linux!=SYSV.  The cygwin fix works...

2003-12-17  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_SYSV:
	Slackware 3.6 didn't error on the sys/termio.h, so I added a check to see
	if SIGCHLD is defined in signal.h

2003-12-14  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_SYSV:
	define SYSV during the test, and include <X11/Xos.h> so we'll get the
	conflicting sys_errlist[].  Documented this for cygwin.  Will have to
	re-test on older linux to be sure that the test breaks.

2003-12-13  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_MAN_PAGES:
	modified to implement --with-manpage-aliases option combined with --without-manpage-symlinks

	* AcSplit/CF_MANPAGE_SYMLINKS:
	ncurses: add --with-manpage-aliases option

	* AcSplit/CF_X_FREETYPE:
	add -lfontconfig, needed on current Cygwin.  Note that current Cygwin is
	broken anyway since the fontconfig package contains only documentation,
	no code (courtesy of Harold Hunt ;-)

	* AcSplit/CF_SYSV:
	don't define SYSV for __CYGWIN__ since this in turn leads to <X11/Xos.h>
	declaring sys_errlist[], which differs from Cygwin's hack (the latter
	adds a 'const').  Comparing with Linux, it seems that's a good way to
	improve the check rather than rely on hardcoded ifdef's.

2003-12-06  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_XOPEN_SOURCE:
	ncurses: make a big default case to handle my preferred _XOPEN_SOURCE definition.

	* AcSplit/CF_XOPEN_SOURCE:
	add __EXTENSIONS__ for solaris* (the scope of this macro is losing focus)

2003-11-29  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* install-sh: copied from install.sh

	* install.sh: nicer(?) version from tin

2003-11-26  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_XOPEN_SOURCE: add case for osf1 (4.x, 5.x)

2003-11-22  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_VERSION_INFO:
	dialog: initially modify so I can read the "0.9b-20031002" version from
	dialog's VERSION file.  This macro will read that, plus the 3-column
	text from cdk's VERSION file, making it a little more general than it was.
	(Not all programs should use libtool).  Also integrated the PACKAGE stuff
	here, so I can define DIALOG_VERSION and DIALOG_PATCHDATE.

2003-11-08  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* config.sub: this is 1.294
	from http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/config/config/

	* config.guess: this is 1.284 (should have a timestamp for 2003/11/3).
	from http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/config/config/

2003-11-07  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_XOPEN_CURSES:
	tack on a check for getbegyx(), since I'm using it and HPUX dropped compat
	for older stuff such as getbegy()/getbegx().

	* AcSplit/CF_XOPEN_SOURCE: ci-aclocal generated header

2003-11-06  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_NCURSES_CPPFLAGS:
	provide CF_CURSES_CPPFLAGS so I can make this an equal dependency of macros
	that use the header-variables

	* AcSplit/CF_CURSES_TERM_H, AcSplit/CF_NCURSES_VERSION:
	require CF_CURSES_CPPFLAGS

	* AcSplit/CF_CURSES_CCHAR_T, AcSplit/CF_CURSES_CHTYPE, AcSplit/CF_CURSES_FUNCS, AcSplit/CF_CURSES_LIBS, AcSplit/CF_TCAP_CURSOR:
	require CF_CURSES_CPPFLAGS and use the derived header

	* AcSplit/CF_CURSES_MOUSE, AcSplit/CF_STRUCT_SCREEN:
	require CF_CURSES_CPPFLAGS and use the derived header variable

	* AcSplit/CF_XOPEN_CURSES:
	require CF_CURSES_CPPFLAGS and use the derived header.

2003-11-01  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_SUFFIX: Date: Mon, 27 Oct 2003 14:55:10 -0500
	From: Jonathan Ward <Jonathan.Ward@hp.com>
	Subject: Patch for HP-UX for Itanium support
	To: bug-ncurses@gnu.org

	The following is a patch for the Itanium releases of HP-UX.  There are several
	key features but the most notable is the library suffix is .so on Itanium
	+libraries
	not .sl as on PA-RISC libraries.


	(omitted a chunk that put a modified-by comment at the top of aclocal.m4)

2003-10-23  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* config.sub: 2003-08-18 (from autoconf 2.57g)

	* config.guess: 2003-10-03 (from autoconf 2.57g)

2003-10-18  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_MAN_PAGES:
	$srcdir seems to work for location of edit_man.sed

	* AcSplit/CF_PROG_EXT:
	use AC_EXEEXT, AC_OBJEXT (which are slated for removal in the next pass of
	autoconf-incompatibilties ;-)

2003-10-11  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_IMAKE_CFLAGS:
	check that we really did find imake or xmkmf, so the script doesn't run amok

2003-10-05  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_ZLIB, AcSplit/CF_WITH_BZLIB:
	ci-aclocal generated header

	* AcSplit/CF_SSL:
	add USE_X509_SUPPORT definition to distinguish this from gnutls

	* AcSplit/CF_GNUTLS:
	add check for x509 support (which is very incomplete)

2003-09-21  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_X_FREETYPE: hmm - Xft is "documented"

2003-09-20  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_NUMBER_SYNTAX, AcSplit/CF_WITH_ABI_VERSION, AcSplit/CF_WITH_REL_VERSION, AcSplit/CF_PROG_LDCONFIG:
	ci-aclocal generated header

	* AcSplit/CF_MIXEDCASE_FILENAMES:
	if cross-compiling, rely on known cases

2003-09-17  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_X_FREETYPE:
	add a couple of symbols needed as stubs to let xterm compile with slightly
	different versions of Xft.

2003-09-14  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_SLANG_CPPFLAGS: add check for slang-utf8 package.

	* AcSplit/CF_BUNDLED_INTL:
	list some of the environment variables (at least the ones I use directly).
	allow override of CONFIG_H symbol (needed for lynx, which renames it).

2003-09-08  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_BUNDLED_INTL: change "head -1" to "sed -e '2,$d'"

2003-09-06  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_GNAT_VERSION:
	ncurses: replace "head -1" with "sed -e '2,$d'", to work when POSIXLY_CORRECT
	is set.  This also gets rid of an unnecessary use of $AWK, and ensures that
	$cf_ada_make is set.

	* AcSplit/CF_GCC_VERSION:
	ncurses: replace "head -1" with "sed -e '2,$d'" to work when POSIXLY_CORRECT
	is set.

	* AcSplit/CF_GXX_VERSION, AcSplit/CF_WITH_LIBTOOL:
	ncurses: replace "head -1" with "sed -e '2,$d'", to work when POSIXLY_CORRECT
	is set.

2003-08-30  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_LIBTOOL:
	ncurses: mods to make this work with libtool 1.5 -- it requires "options"
	that are not really optional, for planned support of other languages than C.

2003-08-20  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_CURSES_FUNCS:
	dialog: add a dependency on CF_CURSES_TERM_H, and include <ncursesw/term.h>
	if that's what it found.

	* AcSplit/CF_CURSES_TERM_H:
	dialog: check for <ncursesw/term.h> if we found <ncursesw/curses.h>.

2003-07-26  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_PREDEFINE: ci-aclocal generated header

2003-07-19  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_RULES:
	Charles Wilson - change prefix on cygwin dll's to "cyg" to avoid conflict
	with other dll's that happen to have the same root name.

	Hi!

	If i'm not confused, you're the maintainer of ncurses, right?

	I mailed you some time ago about your special autoconf templates
	that need your hacked autoconf2.13 to be processed.

	I finaly installed your hacked autoconf2.13 and tested my patches
	for ncurses to support GNU/FreeBSD. My patch works fine and is
	attached; all it does is adding our triplet in a pair of places
	in aclocal.m4

	(his change installs ncurses with --prefix=/usr by default for kfreebsd-gnu)

	(hit change adds shared-library rules for kfreebsd-gnu)

	* config.sub: 2003-07-04
	ncurses - needs k*bsd*gnu

	* config.guess: 2003-07-02
	ncurses: needs k*bsd*gnu

2003-07-05  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_GCC_WARNINGS:
	back-out version 11, which allowed this to set $CFLAGS if $GXX (g++) was
	found.  That doesn't work well when compiling with HPUX cc and g++, since
	the gcc options leak into the cc compile.

2003-06-16  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_BUNDLED_INTL:
	only update $VERSION if it's not set (it should be)

	* AcSplit/CF_BUNDLED_INTL:
	dialog: adapt this to use "my-gettext", which happens to have Makefile.in,
	while po has makefile.inn (by making this macro look for Makefile.in or
	makefile.in).  Also set CONFIG_H and VERSION if they're not set

	* AcSplit/CF_OUR_MESSAGES:
	dialog: prefix the "po/" with "$srcdir/", in case I'd like to use --srcdir

2003-06-10  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_RCS_SCCS:
	add /usr/local/lib/cssc and /usr/lib/cssc, since Debian puts the executables
	for CSSC in /usr/lib/cssc

2003-06-07  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_WITH_LIBTOOL:
	define LIB_PREP as token to substitute for 'ranlib' in makefiles rather
	than 'RANLIB', so I don't accidentally change the $RANLIB that the configure
	script is using, e.g., in the test for broken-linker.

	* AcSplit/CF_SUBST_NCURSES_VERSION:
	don't need to ifdef based on cf_cv_cc_bool_type any more

2003-06-05  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_CURSES_CPPFLAGS:
	change the order that I add to $CPPFLAGS, putting the curses include-directory
	first (noticed this while working on tin)

	* AcSplit/CF_OUR_MESSAGES:
	tin: move logic for MSF_DIR_MAKE from CF_BUNDLED_INTL (which had some
	conflicting logic with INTLDIR_MAKE).
	also added some comments.

	* AcSplit/CF_BUNDLED_INTL:
	tin: move some logic over to CF_OUR_MESSAGES that should have been there,
	e.g., for MSG_DIR_MAKE.  Add some comments.

2003-06-02  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* config.sub: 2003-05-24 (from tin 1.5.18)

2003-05-24  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_GCC_WARNINGS:
	"-Winline" is broken in gcc 3.3 because someone decided to turn on inlining
	by default without adjusting the warning to be less intrusive when no explicit

	add: when attempting to port to OS/2, I found this macro didn't find my

	vile: modified the use of brackets to work with autoconf 2.52, which doesn't
	allow an unbalanced square bracket to happen.

	vile: omit some double quotes which don't appear to be needed, which don't
	work when I generate the configure script with autoconf 2.52

	curses.h
	I did that to make <ncursesw/curses.h> work ok.

	* AcSplit/CF_LIBRARY_PATH:
	lynx: put the /usr/local stuff first, to more closely match gcc's rules.
	This is mainly for symmetry with CF_HEADER_PATH, but may be needed to

	location.  Also, change preference to look for ncurses.h rather than curses.h,
	since it's less likely that we chose the wrong header in that case.

	* AcSplit/CF_MAKE_TAGS, AcSplit/CF_MIXEDCASE_FILENAMES, AcSplit/CF_SYS_TIME_SELECT, AcSplit/CF_TYPEOF_CHTYPE:
	ci-aclocal generated header

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_CACHE:
	ncurses: allow a parameter so we can specify use of AC_CANONICAL_SYSTEM
	rather than AC_CANONICAL_HOST, for cross-compiles.

	* AcSplit/CF_CPP_PARAM_INIT:
	ncurses: change to testing $CXX if it is "yes", to avoid conflict with people's
	environments when they set $CXX to the actual compiler name.

	* AcSplit/CF_ADA_INCLUDE_DIRS:
	ncurses: change to testing if $GCC is "yes", rather than nonnull, avoid problems with people's environment settings.

	* AcSplit/CF_TYPEOF_CHTYPE:
	ncurses: change to using "#ifdef" thoughout, rather than "#if"

	* AcSplit/CF_BOOL_SIZE:
	ncurses: change to using "#ifdef" throughout rather than "#if"

	ncurses: change to using "#ifdef" throughout, rather than "#if"

	* AcSplit/CF_SHARED_OPTS:
	ncurses: eliminate a redundant case for HPUX, check $GCC for equality to
	"yes", and revise rpath support to (try to) eliminate relative paths.

	* AcSplit/CF_FUNC_GETADDRINFO: lynx 2.8.4dev.11

2000-08-31  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_CURSES_LIBS:
	lynx: my juggling of ncurses/curses search order exposed a hole.  If I
	specified the curses library in $LIBS, that might depend on -ltermcap,
	which then would not be found.  Fixed by doing an AC_TRY_LINK explicitly.

2000-08-24  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_FUNC_GETADDRINFO:

2000-07-19  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_CURSES_TERMCAP:

	* config.guess: lynx - os390 changes

2000-07-15  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_MAN_PAGES: mods to make this work with program-prefix
	(very ugly)

2000-07-11  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_CURSES_LIBS:
	lynx: if we've checked for ncurses version and found ncurses, prefer -lncurses
	to avoid problems with misconfigured system where ncurses headers are visible,
	but not library

2000-07-07  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_SUFFIX:
	ncurses: move assumptions about *bsd using REL_VERSION suffix to CF_SHLIB_OPTS

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_RULES:
	ncurses: use $cf_cv_shlib_version and $cf_cv_do_symlinks to handle the
	special case of constructing $cf_suffix.  Most of the shared-library
	suffix logic is in mk-1st.awk, but there's a list of dependencies that
	are generated here.

	* AcSplit/CF_SHARED_OPTS:
	ncurses: various fixes, mostly because I broke something before 5.0 which
	dealt with the rel/abi symbolic links.  This rearranges things so the
	library name passed to mk-1st.awk doesn't have the version number tacked
	onto the ".so" suffix - the main problem.
	Also moved some logic out of CF_LIB_SUFFIX to work with that rearrangement.

2000-07-01  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_SHARED_OPTS: quote a '$' so m4 doesn't eat it

	* AcSplit/CF_MAN_PAGES: sort/uniq the output from manlinks.sed

2000-06-29  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/AM_WITH_NLS:
	Julian Coleman <J.D.Coleman@newcastle.ac.uk> noticed that if the intl
	directory is missing, this macro still tries to make the intl/libintl.h
	link.  Found that AC_LINK_FILES is evaluated at autoconf time, while I
	want to suppress the links at configure time.  Did this by resetting the
	variables used as parameters to AC_LINK_FILES.

2000-06-20  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_ERRNO: John Coyne <John.Coyne@CTBTO.ORG>

	* AcSplit/CF_FUNC_GETADDRINFO: make quoting consistent

2000-04-06  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_TERMCAP_LIBS:
	don't bother looking for termcap functions in libcurses on FreeBSD

	* AcSplit/CF_PROG_PERL: trim trailing blanks

1999-10-30  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* config.guess: add powerpc-apple

1999-10-28  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_UTMP_UT_SESSION: RCS_BASE

	* AcSplit/CF_UTMP: add CF_UTMP_UT_SESSION
	also, add definition for ut_name to ut_user

	* AcSplit/CF_UTMP_UT_XTIME:
	beyond existence check for ut_xtime, add check for missing #define

	* AcSplit/CF_LASTLOG: comments

1999-10-24  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_STDCPP_LIBRARY:
	limit this to checking for variants of g++ (skip vendor's c++)

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_SUFFIX:
	modify for netbsd: the suffix may be simply ".so", or ".so.$(REL_VERSION)",
	depending on whether ld.elf_so is present

	* AcSplit/CF_LINK_FUNCS:
	oops - forgot to #define HAVE_LINK and HAVE_SYMLINK

	* AcSplit/CF_GCC_WARNINGS: put the compiler name into the messages
	(may not be 'gcc')

	* AcSplit/CF_GCC_ATTRIBUTES:
	put the compiler name into the messages - may not be 'cc'

	* AcSplit/CF_GPP_LIBRARY:
	took out the part of the test code that uses 'abs()', since (at least SCO's
	copy of gcc 2.7.2.3) some versions of g++ may report ambiguity in the test
	compile, making the test fail unexpectedly.

	* AcSplit/CF_SHARED_OPTS:
	treat netbsd differently from openbsd/freebsd (from patch).
	fix openbsd/freebsd (I can test FreeBSD, anyway) to keep the REL_VERSION
	on the library suffix (needed for FreeBSD 3.1, still - though someone
	long ago told me it wouldn't be ;-).
	corrections for SCO's shared libraries (what is -melf, anyway?)
	modify linux to use $(CC) rather than gcc.

1999-10-16  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_UTMP_UT_HOST:
	make this use the definitions from CF_UTMP for include-files

1999-10-05  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	RCS_BASE

	* AcSplit/CF_UTMP: add sub-tests for struct members and functions

	* AcSplit/CF_XTERM_MODE:
	more refinements - don't really want to use the -o and -g options if s-bit
	isn't set, since they're also a portability concern.

1999-09-21  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_XTERM_MODE: fixes for 'ls' that inverts the -g option

	oops - typo (masked in ncurses by redundant assignment)

1999-09-08  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_DISABLE_ECHO: Urs dropped the "test: " from help-message

	* AcSplit/CF_DISABLE_ECHO: ci-aclocal generated header

	* AcSplit/CF_MAKEFLAGS: whitespace

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_1_DECL:
	workaround for trash in glibc2's headers - if we're compiling with extra
	includes (e.g., for tin and vile), double-check that we can compile properly
	_with_ the headers.

1999-09-04  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_GPP_LIBRARY:
	add check for HAVE_BUILTIN_H, so we don't accidentally pickup qt's builtin.h

	* AcSplit/CF_STDCPP_LIBRARY, AcSplit/CF_GPP_LIBRARY: RCS_BASE

	* AcSplit/CF_PROG_EXT:
	add CXXFLAGS, which lets me build ncurses c++ demo (it needs to be built
	with threaded code since the rest of the library is, so that break's
	errno's definition otherwise)

	* AcSplit/CF_SRC_MODULES:
	change ncurses "--without-cxx" configure option so there's now also
	a "--without-cxx-binding" option.  That changes naming in this macro

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_PREFIX:
	define LIB_PREFIX for substitution to handle special case in ncurses/c++
	directory

1999-08-29  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_FD_SET:
	integrate more/less with the older CF_TYPE_FD_SET

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_FD_SET, AcSplit/CF_HEADER_RESOURCE, AcSplit/CF_HEADER_SELECT:
	RCS_BASE

	* AcSplit/CF_TERMCAP_LIBS:
	check for curses library first - on terminfo systems that's the only way
	to get color.

1999-08-22  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

1999-08-21  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_BOOL_DECL:
	allow for bogus definitions of bool and false in <sys/types.h> and <stdio.h>

	int.

	* AcSplit/CF_FUNC_SIGACTION: RCS_BASE

	* AcSplit/CF_FUNC_SIGACTION: ci-aclocal generated header

1999-06-21  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_MAKEFLAGS:
	correct (I had used 'set' as if this was csh!) and improve (by checking
	the expansion of $(MAKEFLAGS) if assignments are passed through, like the
	POSIX make program on IRIX64 6.2).

1999-06-19  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_SPEED_TYPE:
	change default 'ospeed' type to 'unsigned' from 'short'

	* AcSplit/CF_SPEED_TYPE: ci-aclocal generated header

	* AcSplit/CF_SRC_MODULES: Juergen renamed ada_include to src

	* AcSplit/CF_GNAT_VERSION: don't pass $(GENOBJS) - jpf

	* AcSplit/CF_LIB_SUFFIX: hurd (gnu) is treated like linux

	* AcSplit/CF_BOOL_SIZE:
	tell which compiler we're testing - may be CC as well

1999-05-22  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_LEX_STATES: RCS_BASE

	* AcSplit/CF_LEX_STATES: ci-aclocal generated header

	* AcSplit/CF_MAKEFLAGS:
	prefer $(MAKEFLAGS) to $(MFLAGS), since the latter is more standard now,
	and incidentally gmake passes '=' stuff along with it.

	* AcSplit/CF_XTERM_MODE:
	allow for possibility that xterm's installed via a symbolic link

	* AcSplit/CF_ANSI_CC_CHECK, AcSplit/CF_GCC_WARNINGS: parenthesis

	use unsigned literals for chtype if we've got them

1997-12-23  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_CURSES_LIBS:
	restructured so I'm checking for more combinations (prompted by bug
	report that SUSE installs ncurses, not "curses", but also by noting that
	the tgoto/initscr combinations weren't expanded properly when I went to
	add ncurses to the list)

1997-12-17  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_CURSES_TERMCAP:

	* AcSplit/CF_IMAKE_CFLAGS:
	add logic to ensure we don't allow -nostdinc and -I/usr/include (used

	* AcSplit/CF_PROG_YACC: RCS_BASE

1997-12-01  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_ERRNO: oops: more than one err

1997-11-30  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_MISSING_CHECK:
	use CHECK_DECL_HDRS rather than explicit list, to make this reusable.
	(vile now uses estruct.h's list)

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_FUNCDECL: make this more rigorous
	(use a less common type)

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_FUNCDECLS: use CF_UPPER, reverse the order of ifdefs

	* AcSplit/CF_REMOVE_BROKEN:
	(Philippe De Muyter) define REMOVE_BROKEN if unknown (cross-compiling)

	* AcSplit/CF_CHECK_FUNCDECL, AcSplit/CF_CHECK_FUNCDECLS: RCS_BASE

	* AcSplit/CF_REMOVE_BROKEN, AcSplit/CF_UNION_WAIT:
	ci-aclocal generated header

	* AcSplit/CF_UNION_WAIT:
	make this a stronger test by compiling against 'wait()', and linking
	to ensure that we'll use the macros rather than implied functions.

1997-11-06  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_ADD_INCDIR:
	don't special-case /usr/local/include, since gcc 2.6.3 doesn't include it
	anyway (and apparently it's possible to misinstall 2.7.2 so that doesn't
	work either).

1997-11-01  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_CFG_DEFAULTS, AcSplit/CF_LIB_SUFFIX:

	* AcSplit/CF_NCURSES_CPPFLAGS: minor cleanup, add CF_NCURSES_VERSION

	* AcSplit/CF_NCURSES_VERSION:
	add an AC_TRY_RUN test, since unproto splits the preprocessor stuff I'd
	concocted, making it unusable for getting the actual version.

	* AcSplit/CF_FUNC_SYSTEM:
	add dependency so I don't need to invoke CF_UNION_WAIT explicitly

	* AcSplit/CF_FUNC_SYSTEM: ci-aclocal generated header

	integration with vile, need to define HAVE_LIB_xxx

1997-09-28  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* AcSplit/CF_IMAKE_CFLAGS:
